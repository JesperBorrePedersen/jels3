### Description

This repository contains the data, code and supplementary information for our manuscript: _Pedersen, Jesper Borre, Poulsen, Martin Egelund & Felix Riede (2022). Jels 3, a New Late Paleolithic Open-Air Site in Denmark, Sheds Light on the Pioneer Colonization of Northern Europe_. 

### Abstract

The Late Upper Paleolithic Hamburgian tradition reflects the earliest known human presence in northern Europe after the Last Glacial Maximum. We here report on the open-air site of Jels 3 (Denmark) and its associated stone tool assemblage, which unambiguously can be attributed to this period. Along with only a handful of other sites, Jels 3 represents the northernmost limits of human expansion in Europe at this time. We conduct a technological analysis of the lithic material from Jels 3 and other relevant sites to shed new light on the behavioral processes that likely underwrote this expansion. Given that sites dating to this initial dispersal remain few, are restricted to certain geographic regions, and represent an overall lack of a well-developed settlement hierarchy we suggest that this dispersal process is most commensurable with the earlier stages of a leap-frogging colonization targeting specific landscape elements, and that it quite possibly was very short-lived.

### Keywords

Late Glacial, human dispersal, lithic technology, landscape learning, mobility, Hamburgian culture

### Getting Started with the Code

This repository contains the code and the archaeological data required to replicate our analysis.  

The folder structure of this repository and the software requirements for the analysis are outlined below. 

All code required for the analysis and reproduction of the figures can be found in the scripts in the `2_scripts` folder.

### Software Requirements

The analysis was developed and carried out using R version 4.1.3 and the following packages: `tidyverse` (>= 1.3.1), `FactoMineR` (>= 2.4), `here` (>= 1.0.1), `raster` (>= 3.5-15), `sp` (>= 1.4-6), `maptools` (>= 1.1-1).
